                <h3>Fullstack Developer</h3>
                <p>I've been involved in software development since 2017. It started when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. That's why I decided to look at different jobs. When I came across programming, I immediately realized that it was the right thing for me.
                    Shortly thereafter, I completed my <a tooltip="In German it calls Fachabitur, it is a certificate entitling students to study at a University of Applied Sciences">vocational diploma</a> in the field of business informatics.
                    I studied computer science at the <a tooltip="Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen">THM</a>. During my studies I had no preferences in any field. This is because I have a lot of fun programming and was always curious to get to know the different areas and programming languages.
                    As a result, I gained a lot of experience and knowledge in various programming languages ​​and frameworks and am still willing and open to getting to know new technologies and dealing with them intensively</p>
